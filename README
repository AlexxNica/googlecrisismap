Building and running Stratomap
------------------------------

Setup:
  Ensure that you have svn, ant, and a JDK installed.

  Download the Closure library: http://developers.google.com/closure/library
  and the Closure compiler: http://developers.google.com/closure/compiler

  Download the App Engine SDK (get the LINUX ZIP FILE regardless of your OS):
  http://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads

  Put the Closure library and compiler in $HOME/closure and unzip the SDK in
  $HOME/google_appengine.  All of the following should exist:
    $HOME/closure/closure/goog/
    $HOME/closure/third_party/closure/goog/
    $HOME/closure/compiler.jar
    $HOME/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py

To build and run, simply:
  make
  tools/run

...then visit the local server at http://localhost:8000/.  You can edit
JS files and see the changes just by re-running "make" and hitting Reload
in your browser; no need to restart the server.

The first run of "make" will take about 5 minutes or so because it needs
to download and build the whole google-caja project to generate one little
file, html4-defs.js.  This only has to happen once; subsequent runs of
"make" will be much faster.


Running the tests
-----------------

Setup:
  Install py.test: sudo easy_install-2.5 pytest

  Install google-js-test: http://code.google.com/p/google-js-test/

To run the tests:
  tools/pytests
  tools/jstests
